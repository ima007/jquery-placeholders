### Basics

*Include the latest version of jquery (1.7 or 1.7.1)
*Include jquery.placeholders-0.1.js
*Start it off by selecting a container you’d like to add placeholder support

    $("#exampleContainer").placeholders();
	
Or if you want the entire document:

    $("body").placeholders();


*Make sure all inputs/textareas that have placeholders also have a “name” attribute defined.
*Just use the “placeholder” attribute on any inputs (type  = text/search/password) or textareas, and you’re good to go!
*A “hasPlaceHolder” class will be on all inputs that have placeholders & aren’t focused, so you can style the text color in browsers that don’t support placeholders.
*You also have the option of passing “true” to the placeholders method, in order to add/remove a “hasPlaceHolder” class in all browsers, in case you want to style the text color everywhere.


### Notes

*While the plugin uses the delegate-event binding method, you still can’t dynamically create inputs after calling the placeholders method (yet…)
*Make sure your default input/textarea styles are based on the container (so something like .container textarea). The plugin doesn’t copy any classes or inline styles used on your original inputs (yet…)
